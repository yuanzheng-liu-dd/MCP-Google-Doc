# Google Docs MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows you to connect to Google Docs through Claude. With this server, you can:

- List all Google Docs in your Drive
- Read the content of specific documents
- Create new documents
- Update existing documents
- Search for documents
- Delete documents

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16.0.0 or later
- Google Cloud project with the Google Docs API and Google Drive API enabled
- OAuth 2.0 credentials for your Google Cloud project

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MCP-Google-Doc.git
cd MCP-Google-Doc
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID in the Google Cloud Console:

   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google Docs API and Google Drive API
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Desktop app" for the application type
   - Download the JSON file and save it as `credentials.json` in your project directory

   > **Important**: The `credentials.json` and `token.json` files contain sensitive information and are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. Never commit these files to your repository.

4. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

5. Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The first time you run the server, it will prompt you to authenticate with Google. Follow the on-screen instructions to authorize the application. This will generate a `token.json` file that stores your access tokens.

## Security Considerations

- **Credential Security**: Both `credentials.json` and `token.json` contain sensitive information and should never be shared or committed to version control. They are already added to the `.gitignore` file.
- **Token Refresh**: The application automatically refreshes the access token when it expires.
- **Revoking Access**: If you need to revoke access, delete the `token.json` file and go to your [Google Account Security settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security) to remove the app from your authorized applications.

## Connecting to Claude for Desktop

To use this server with Claude for Desktop:

1. Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

   - On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the following to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "googledocs": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/build/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/build/server.js` with the actual path to your built server.js file.

## Connecting to Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio google-docs node /absolute/path/to/build/server.js
```

3. Restart Claude for Desktop.

### Adding New Features

To add new features to the MCP server:

1. Modify the `src/server.ts` file to implement new functionality
2. Build the project with `npm run build`
3. Test your changes by running `npm start`

## Available Resources

- `googledocs://list` - Lists all Google Docs in your Drive
- `googledocs://{docId}` - Gets the content of a specific document by ID

## Available Tools

- `create-doc` - Creates a new Google Doc with the specified title and optional content
- `update-doc` - Updates an existing Google Doc with new content (append or replace)
- `search-docs` - Searches for Google Docs containing specific text
- `delete-doc` - Deletes a Google Doc by ID

## Available Prompts

- `create-doc-template` - Helps create a new document based on a specified topic and writing style
- `analyze-doc` - Analyzes the content of a document and provides a summary

## Usage Examples

Here are some example prompts you can use with Claude once the server is connected:

- "Show me a list of all my Google Docs"
- "Create a new Google Doc titled 'Meeting Notes' with the content 'Topics to discuss: ...'"
- "Update my document with ID '1abc123def456' to add this section at the end: ..."
- "Search my Google Docs for any documents containing 'project proposal'"
- "Delete the Google Doc with ID '1abc123def456'"
- "Create a formal document about climate change"
- "Analyze the content of document with ID '1abc123def456'"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Delete the `token.json` file in your project directory
2. Run the server again to trigger a new authentication flow

If you're having trouble with the Google Docs API:

1. Make sure the API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console
2. Check that your OAuth credentials have the correct scopes
